# images are built, the older images can become dangled which can later be cleaned up.
#
# **NOTE**
# - We still keep the tags of the following pattern because we still need some cache so that next builds are faster
#	a. oryxdevms/build:latest
#	b. oryxdevms/python-<major.minor>:latest
#	b. oryxdevms/node-<major.minor>:latest
#	b. oryxdevms/dotnetcore-<major.minor>:latest
# - We should untag these images only after they have been pushed to a remote repository.

# The following code snippet is a hack to workaround the following issue:
# Our CI agents run under a non-root account, but docker containers run under the 'root' account.
# Since a non-root account cannot delete files created by a 'root' account, we try to run a
# docker container and run the clean up command from there using the volume mounted directory trick.
# 
# This is required for end-to-end tests to work, where a host's directory is volume mounted to a build
# image and the same host directory is volume mounted to a runtime image too.
#
# Even though Docker has a way to run a container as a non-root (for example, in our case the CI agent account),
# this causes problems in build image where we try to install packages and stuff and we run into permission problems.
# Since that is too intrusive and error prone, this hack allows us to not worry about those permission issues.
