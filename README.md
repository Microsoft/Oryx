# Oryx

[![Build Status](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apis/build/status/Oryx/Oryx-BuildImage?branchName=master)](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/latest?definitionId=9922?branchName=master)

Oryx is a build system which automatically compiles source code repos into
runnable artifacts.

Oryx generates and runs an opinionated build script based on analysis of the
repo's contents; for example, if `package.json` is discovered in the repo
Oryx includes `npm run build` in the build script; if `requirements.txt` is
found it includes `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Oryx also analyzes and
selects a run-time entry point for the app such as `npm run start` for
Node.js or a WSGI host for Python.

# Supported runtimes

Runtime | Version
--------|--------
Python  | 2.7<br />3.6, 3.7
Node.js | 4.4, 4.5, 4.8<br />6.2, 6.6, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11<br />8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.8, 8.9, 8.11, 8.12<br />9.4<br />10.1, 10.10, 10.14, 10.15
.NET Core | 1.0, 1.1<br />2.0, 2.1, 2.2

Patches (0.0.**x**) are applied as soon as possible after they are released upstream.

# Use the system yourself

Though primarily intended for use within Azure services, you can also use the
Oryx build system yourself for troubleshooting and tests. Following are
simple instructions; for more details see [our docs](./doc).

Oryx includes two command-line applications; the first is included in the
build image and generates a build script. The second is included in run
images and generates a run script. Both are aliased and accessible as `oryx`
in their respective environments.

## Build (`oryx build`)

* `build`: Generate and run build scripts.
* `script`: Generate build script and print to stdout.
* `languages`: Show the list of supported languages and versions.

For all options, specify `oryx --help`.

The build command takes the parameter `--output` to specify where prepared
artifacts will be placed; if not specified the source directory is used for
output as well.

Oryx detects which programming platforms are used and attempts to build all of them.
There are ways to turn off specific platforms or even any platform other than the
one given to `oryx build`. For details on the configuration, please refer
to [Oryx configuration](./doc/configuration.md#oryx-configuration).

## Run (`oryx -appPath`)

The Oryx application in the run image generates a start script named run.sh, by
default in the same folder as the compiled artifact.

## Build and run an app

To build and run an app from a repo, follow these steps. An example script
follows.

1. Mount the repo's directory as a volume in Oryx's "build" container.
1. Run `oryx build ...` within the container to build a runnable artifact.
1. Mount the output directory from build in one of Oryx's "run" containers.
1. Run `oryx --appPath ...` within the container to write a start script.
1. Run the generated started script, by default `./run.sh`.

From your locally-cloned repo, run the following. Be sure to add
`-p/--publish` and `-e/--env` flags to the "run" docker command as necessary.

```bash
# build
docker run --volume $(pwd):/repo \
    'mcr.microsoft.com/oryx/build:latest' \
    'oryx build /repo --output /repo/out'

# run
docker run --detach --rm \
    --volume $(pwd)/out:/app \
    # use --publish to expose ports
    # --publish 8080:8080 \
    # use --env to add env vars
    # --env MYKEY=value \
    'mcr.microsoft.com/oryx/node-10.12:latest' \
    # or use the Python image
    # 'mcr.microsoft.com/oryx/python-3.7:latest \
    sh -c 'oryx -appPath /app && /app/run.sh'
```
