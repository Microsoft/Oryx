We welcome all contributions to the Oryx project: questions and answers, bug
reports, feature requests and source code. Please submit these using GitHub
issues and pull requests.

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the
rights to use your contribution. For details, visit

When you submit a pull request, a bot will determine whether you need to
provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do
this once across all repositories using our CLA.
